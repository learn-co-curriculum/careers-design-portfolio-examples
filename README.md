# Design Portfolio Examples

By now youâ€™ve probably completed, or are close to completing the creation of your design portfolio.

Whether you're setting up multiple pages or going with a minimalist aesthetic, your portfolio is your window to the outside world and a powerful part of the personal brand you are cultivating for yourself both online and in real life.

When designing or revising your portfolio down the road, ask yourself the following questions:

- Who am I as a designer?
- Where am I applying?
- How can I do more with less?
- How can I match my portfolio to my brand?
- Do my case studies* highlight my design abilities in a way that I can articulate with a companion deck for interviews?

*Case studies are the single best way to demonstrate to hiring managers what they really want to see: your design capabilities and how you work within a team. Ensure your case studies are strong and flushed out. 

For a deeper dive into curating your portfolio, a great designer and Designation alum Yitong Zhang wrote a [Medium article](https://medium.com/response-to-questions-from-younger-designers/summary-of-portfolio-building-advice-697860fc1b21)  that outlines a lot of what companies and agencies look for.

Refer to the design curriculum that your instructor previously reviewed with you to brush up on the key elements of a powerful design portfolio.
